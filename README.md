# Thin-film-optical-spectra
Calculation of reflection, transmission and absorption spectra of thin films using transfer matrix method.
This script uses the refractive index (N = n + ik) of a material (e.g. Silicon) for the calculation of the corresponding reflection, transmission and absorption spectra in the visible-nearIR optical range for a user-specified thickness of a thin film.
